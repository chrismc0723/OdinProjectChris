    <h2>MORE HTML ATTRIBUTES</h2>
    <p>Now that we're more comfortable with HTML attribute syntax, we can add 
        some finishing touches to our HTML boilerplate code. Every web page 
    you create should define the language it's written in and it's character set.</p>

    <h3>DOCUMENT LANGUAGE</h3>
    <p>A web page's default language is defined by the lang attribute on the top level html element.
        Out document is in English, so we'll use the en country code as the attribute value.
        If you aren't sure on your country code, look it up here <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">country codes</a>
    </p>

    <h3>CHARACTER SETS</h3>
    <p>A character set is kind of like a digital alphabet for your browser. It's 
        different from the language your document in that it only affects how 
        the letters themselves are rendered, not the language of the content.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>bir</li>
        <li>iki</li>
        <li>üç</li>
        <li>dört</li>
        <li>beş</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When this is viewed in your browser, you can sometimes see weird stuff with the characters.
        This is because the default character set for most browsers don't accommodate
        these "special" characters. To fix this you specify UTF-8 character encoding by
        adding a meta element with a charset attribute to the head of the file
    </p>

    <p>These days, UTF-8 is a sort of universal alphabet for the Internet.
        Every web page you create should have this line in its head.
    </p>

    
    <h2>HTML ENTITIES</h2>
    <p>This isn't related to images or links as such but needs discussed before moving onto CSS.
        An HTML entiry is a special character that can't be represented in plain text in a HTML document.
        This typically means it's a reserved character in HTML or you don't have a key on your keyboard for it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>RESERVED CHARACTERS</h3>
    <p>The "<" ">" and "&" are called reserved characters because they aren't allowed to be inserted into a html document
        without being encoded. This is because they mean something in the HTML syntax. 1 starts a tag, 2 ends a tag and 3 sets of a HTML entity.
    </p>
    <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
   should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
   <p>Entities always begin with an ampersand and end with a semicolon, In between you put a special code that your browser will 
        interpret as a symbol. In this case, it interprets lt, gt, and amp as less-than, greater-than, and ampersand symbols, respectively.
   </p>
   <p>There's a crap-ton of HTML entities, explore here <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html">HTML entities</a></p>

   <h3>QUOTES</h3>
   <p>Curly quotes aren't necessary, however if you care about <a href="https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/web-typography/">typography</a> 
        they'll be some of the most common HTML entities you'll use. There's four
        different kinds of curly quotes (opening and closing single and double quotes):
        <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;</li>
            <li>&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&lsquo;</li>
            <li>&rsquo;</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
        yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike straight quotes, these curly quote entities should hug the text.</p>

    <h2>COMMIT MESSAGES</h2>
    <p>Good commits are useful whether that be helping keep track of changes, making it easier for others to understand what changes were made,
        or even to help you remember your thought process when you've been away from a prpoject for a while.
    </p>
    
    <p>A bad commit: fix a bug</p>

    <p>An effective commit consists of 2 seperate parts: a subject, and a body:</p>
    <p>Subject: A brief summary of the change you made to the project: This is the change I made to the codebase</p>

    <p>Github has a 72-character limit, so keep commit subjects within this amount</p>
    <p>Body: A concice yet clear description of what you did</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Describe the problem your commit solves and how.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now that we learned the secret to creating a good commit message, let's try and fix the commit message from earlier:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add missing link and alt text to the company's logo</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities without this information</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This is better as now developers can gain a better understanding of this commit message
        as it does the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides a subject that specifies the code's action</li>
        <li>Contains a body that provides a concise yet clear description of why the commit needed to be made</li>
        <li>Seperates the subject from the body with a new/blank line. This is a best practice. It makes commit messages easier for other developers to read</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to commit with a subject and body in the message</h3>
    <p>at first you will start off by using git commit -m message.
        To make a commit with subject and body in message,
        the simplest way is to type git commit without the -m flag and message argument
    </p>
    <p>doing so will open a new VSCode tab if you have set VSCode as the Git editor</p>

    <h3>When to commit</h3>
    <p>It's good to view a commit like a snapshot of your code at the moment it was made
        That version of your code up to that point will be saved for you to revent back to or look back at
    </p>
    <p>when writing code, it's best practice to commit every time you make a meaningful change in the code.
        This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn't appear out of nowhere
    </p>
    <p>In other words, make a commit if you get a piece of code you are working on to function like you want it to,
        fix a typo, or fix a bug. 
    </p>
    <p>There will come a time when you are working on a project and you FINALLY get something just right,
        this would be a good time to commit, and then 30 seconds to a few days later it breaks. You have no idea what you changed,
        everything looks to be the same and you don't recall editing that line. You'd be capable of going back 
        through your commit history and either revert your code back to the last commit you made
        when you first got that part working or go back and see what your code looked like at that point in time
