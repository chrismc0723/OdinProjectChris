    <h2>MORE HTML ATTRIBUTES</h2>
    <p>Now that we're more comfortable with HTML attribute syntax, we can add 
        some finishing touches to our HTML boilerplate code. Every web page 
    you create should define the language it's written in and it's character set.</p>

    <h3>DOCUMENT LANGUAGE</h3>
    <p>A web page's default language is defined by the lang attribute on the top level html element.
        Out document is in English, so we'll use the en country code as the attribute value.
        If you aren't sure on your country code, look it up here <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry">country codes</a>
    </p>

    <h3>CHARACTER SETS</h3>
    <p>A character set is kind of like a digital alphabet for your browser. It's 
        different from the language your document in that it only affects how 
        the letters themselves are rendered, not the language of the content.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>bir</li>
        <li>iki</li>
        <li>üç</li>
        <li>dört</li>
        <li>beş</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When this is viewed in your browser, you can sometimes see weird stuff with the characters.
        This is because the default character set for most browsers don't accommodate
        these "special" characters. To fix this you specify UTF-8 character encoding by
        adding a meta element with a charset attribute to the head of the file
    </p>

    <p>These days, UTF-8 is a sort of universal alphabet for the Internet.
        Every web page you create should have this line in its head.
