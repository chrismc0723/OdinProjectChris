    <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a

        extras</a>.</p>
    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>There are 4 main image formats.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JPG</li>
        <li>GIF</li>
        <li>PNG</li>
        <li>SVG</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>JPG IMAGES</h3>
    <p>JPG images are designed for handling large colour palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size.</p>
    <p>This makes them great for photos with lots of gradients in them.</p>
    <p>However, JPGs don't allow transparent pixels</p>

    <h3>GIF IMAGES</h3>
    <p>GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that they are somewhat
        limited in terms of colour palette - never use them for photos.
    </p>
    <p>Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can't have semi-opaque pixels.
        Making it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background. Better to use PNG images if you don't need animation
    </p>
    <img src="../misc_extras/mochi.gif"/>

    <h3>PNG IMAGES</h3>
    <p>PNGs are great for anything that's not a photo or animated. FOr photos, a png file of the same quality
        would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file. However, they do deal with opacity just fine,
        and they don't jave colour palette limitations. Makes it an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>SVG IMAGES</h3>
    <p>unlike pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based graphics format,
        meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality.
        This makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design. They're good
        for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs, and you should use them whenever you can.
    </p>
    
    <img src="../misc_extras/mochi.svg"/>

    <p>There is a potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently across browsers,
        you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your image editor. If your images contain a lot of text,
        such as fancy screenshots for a tutorial, this can have a big impact on the file size. 
    </p>

    <h3>IMAGE DIMENSIONS</h3>
    <p>By default, the img element uses the inherit dimensions of its image file. Our files are 150x150 pixels apart 
        from the SVG mochi as that is only 75x75
    </p>
    <p>Pixel-based image formats need to be twice as big as you want them to appear on retina displays. To
        get our pixel-based images down to the intended size (75x75), we can use the img element's width attribute.
    </p>
    <!-- JPG Image Resize-->
    <h4>JPG Resize</h4>
    <img src="../misc_extras/mochi.jpg" width="75"/>

    <!--GIF Image Resize-->
    <h4>GIF Resize</h4>
    <img src="../misc_extras/mochi.gif" width="75"/>

    <!--PNG Image Resize-->
    <h4>PNG Resize</h4>
    <img src="../misc_extras/mochi.png" width="75"/>

    <p>The width attribute sets an explicit dimension for the image. There's a
        corrosponding height attribute as well. Setting only one of them will 
        cause the image to scale proportionally, while defining both will stretch
        the image. Dimension values are specified in pixels, and you should never
        include a unit.

        The width and height attributes can be useful, but it's usually better 
        to set image dimensions with CSS so you can alter them with media queries. 
        This will be discussed later.
    </p>

    <h3>TEXT ALTERNATIVES</h3>
    <p>Adding the alt attributes to your img elements is a best practice. it defines
        a text alternative to the image being displayed. This has an impact on both 
        search engines and users with text-only browsers, such as people that use 
        text-to-speech software due to visual impairments.
    </p>
