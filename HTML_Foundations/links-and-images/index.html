    <p>this link opens on a new tab</p>
    <p>rel is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document</p>
    <p>noopener value of the rel attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab can't interact with 
        or access the original page, without this the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page</p>

    <p>noopener prevents new tab from accessing the original page, ensuring security.</p>

    <p>The prevention of access caused by noopener prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage
            to a different one to trick users</p>
    <p>This is referred to as tabnapping</p>
    <p>some browsers provide security but it's best to air on the side of caution</p>
    <p>it is recommended to always pair a target=_blank" with a rel="noreferrer"</p>

    <H2>Absolute and Relative Links</H2>
    <p>absolute links are links to pages on other websites on the internet</p>
    <p>such as <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a> </p>
    <p>relative links are links to other pages within our own website</p>
    <p>example</p>
    <a href="pages/about.html">About</a>
    <p>prepending ./ before the link should prevent some unexpected issues so this should be ./pages/about.html</p>
    <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
    <p>Adding ./ specifies to the code it should start looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory</p>

    <h3>Metaphor for Absolute and Relative Links</h3>
    <p>Think of your domain name (town.com) as a town, the directory in which your</p>
    <p>website is location (/museum) as a museum, and each page on your website as</p>
    <p>a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html) and</p>
    <p>(museum/shops/coffee_shop.html). Relative links like</p>
    <p>./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current room</p>
    <p>(the museum move room /museum/movie_room.html) to another room (the museum shop).</p>
    <p>Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol</p>
    <p>(https), domain name (town.com) and the path from that domain name</p>
    <p>(/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html):</p>
    <p>https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html</p>
    
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>luckily html provides a wide variety of elements for displaying all sorts of different media</p>
    <p>we use img element for displaying images. img element is a void element</p>
    <p>this means we don't need a closing tag</p>
    <p>instead it embeds an image into the page using a src attribute which tells the browser where the image file is location</p>
    <p>The src attribute works like the href attribute for anchor tags. It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths</p>

    <p>Using an absolute path we can display an image located on The Odin Project site:</p>
    <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">

    <p>to display images that are hosted on your own web server, you can use a relative path</p>
    <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="a dog">

    <p>the alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place if the image can't be loaded</p>
    <p>it is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users</p>

    <p>not required but can help the browser layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash is specifying the height and width attributes in image tags</p>
    <p>it is a good habit to always specify these attributes on every image, even if the image is the correct size or you are using css to modify it</p>
    <p>this is to prevent content jumping as images load. Use the image's actual dimensions</p>
    <img src="./images/dog.jpg" alt="A dog" height="250" width="250">
